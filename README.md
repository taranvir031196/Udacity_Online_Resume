# INTERACTIVE ONLINE RESUME

This is the a project in my front end nanodegree in which i had to make an interactive online resume.
While doing this i made use of javascript in order to displaythe data as well used
google maps in which i used the locations extracted out of resume.

I really enjoyed a lot building this resume and also learnt a new way of building it.
